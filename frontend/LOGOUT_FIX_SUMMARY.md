# Logout Issue Fix Summary

## üîç **Problem Identified**
The logout was failing with "unauthorized token" because:

1. **Missing Cookie Parser**: Backend was trying to read cookies (`req.cookies`) but had no cookie parser middleware
2. **Token Validation Issues**: Refresh tokens might be invalid, expired, or not properly stored
3. **Error Handling**: Frontend wasn't handling 401 errors gracefully

## ‚úÖ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Backend Fixes**

#### Added Cookie Parser
- **File**: `backend/server.js`
- **Change**: Added `cookie-parser` middleware
- **Dependency**: Added `"cookie-parser": "^1.4.6"` to `package.json`

#### Improved Logout Controller
- **File**: `backend/controllers/auth/logoutController.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Better error handling
  - Always clear cookies even if token not found in DB
  - Return success even if token was already invalid
  - Added logging for debugging

### 2. **Frontend Fixes**

#### Enhanced Logout Function
- **File**: `frontend/lib/utils/http/auth/logout_user.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Better error handling for 401 responses
  - Graceful handling when no refresh token exists
  - Added detailed logging for debugging
  - Always clear local storage and mark user as logged out

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 2. **Restart Backend Server**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### 3. **Test Logout**
- Try logging out from both web and mobile
- Check console logs for debugging information
- Verify tokens are properly cleared

## üîß **How It Works Now**

### **Web Logout Flow**:
1. Frontend sends DELETE request to `/api/auth/logout`
2. Backend reads refresh token from httpOnly cookies
3. Backend deletes token from database
4. Backend clears the cookie
5. Frontend clears access token from local storage
6. User marked as logged out

### **Mobile Logout Flow**:
1. Frontend reads refresh token from secure storage
2. Frontend sends DELETE request with Authorization header
3. Backend validates token and deletes from database
4. Frontend clears both tokens from secure storage
5. User marked as logged out

### **Error Handling**:
- If token is invalid/expired: Still mark user as logged out
- If no token found: Clear local storage and mark as logged out
- If server error: Clear cookies/storage and mark as logged out

## üìä **Expected Behavior**

‚úÖ **Successful Logout**: User is logged out and redirected
‚úÖ **Invalid Token**: User is still logged out (graceful degradation)
‚úÖ **No Token**: User is logged out locally
‚úÖ **Server Error**: User is logged out locally

## üêõ **Debugging**

Check these logs for debugging:
- **Backend**: Look for "Logout attempt for token" messages
- **Frontend**: Look for "Web logout" or "Mobile logout" messages
- **Browser Console**: Check for CORS or network errors
